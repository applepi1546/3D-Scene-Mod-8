# 3D-Scene-Mod-8

### How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  - One of the biggest skills that I have learned from this project is the ability to design and layout a scene as well a build it. I was able to learn how to set up the scene, as well as brainstorming how to effectively and efficiently design and recreate the scene.
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
  - The design process that I follow for my project is that after taking pictures and setting up my project, I was ready and finally started researching and imaging how I will set up and the best way to design the scene.
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  - In my future work, whenever I am setting up and designing any software I will follow the process of brainstorm, research, and plan before putting my ideas into actions and start creating the image. 

  
### How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  - One new development strategies that I use while working on my 3D scene is that I start running my code one-by-one each time after building the meshes. Since it's my first time using OpenGL, I took time and always make sure my shape, lighting, and texture is exactly as my intentions before moving on to the next shape.
- How did iteration factor into your development?
  - Iteration helped me with speeding up my development process, since some of the shapes were reuse, I could just reuse the code and make the shape easier by just rotating, scaling, and moving the size. 
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  - During the beginning of my development process, my code was messy, and I was struggling to organize and really read through the code. So, after working more through each milestone, I learned to create methods that organize and keep my code neat and in place.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  - Computational graphics and visualizations will potentially help with my bettering my skill and potentially the future classes that I will take like Full-Stack, or Capstone will call my OpenGL skill and designing skill into those classes.
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  - If I ever I want to take part in building a game or be a part of visuals for applications, then this course will help me a lot. It taught me the basics of OpenGL, how to do lighting, textures, and all the things that make a shape realistic and usable. This could be something I spend more time as if I truly have a passion for computer graphics and dedicating myself to bettering myself.
